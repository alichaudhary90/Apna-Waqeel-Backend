Here, though B was not capable by law of \ncommitting an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been \ncapable by law of committing ah offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore \nsubject to the punishment of death.  \n  \n(c) \nA instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house, B, in consequence of the unsoundness \nof his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is \nwrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of As instigation.

        "description": "possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to \nsuch taking, is said to commit theft.  \n  \nExplanation 1: A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is \nnot the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is \nserved from the earth.  \n  \nExplanation 2: A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a \ntheft.  \n  \nExplanation 3: A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle, which \nprevented it from moving, or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually \nmoving it,  \n  \nExplanation 4: A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that \nanimal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved \nby that animal.  \n  \nExplanation 5: The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may \nbe given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose \nauthority either express or implied.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n(a) \nA cuts down a tree on Z's ground with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out \nof Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to \nsuch taking, the has committed theft.  \n  \n(b) \nA puts a bait for dogs in his pockets, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here if A's \nintention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent A has \ncommitted theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.  \n  \n(c) \nA meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain \ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins \nto move, A has committed theft of the treasure.  \n  \n(d) \nA being Z's servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs \naway with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.  \n  \n(e) \nZ. going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall \nreturn. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in 2's \npossession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed \ntheft though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.  \n  \n(f) \nA finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring \nin Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it. A commits theft.  \n  \n(g) \nA finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A. by taking \nit, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property,  \n  \n(h) \nA sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to \nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection A hides the ring in a \nplace where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z. with the intention of taking \nthe ring from the hiding place and soiling it when the toss is forgotten Here A. at the time of \nfirst moving the ring, commits the theft.  \n  \n(i) \nA delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not \nowing to the jeweller, any debt for which the jewellers might lawfully detain the watch as a \nsecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Y's hand, and carries it \naway. Here A. though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not \ncommitted theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.  \n  \n(j) \nIf A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a \nsecurity for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of \ndepriving Z of the property as security for his debt. he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes \nit dishonestly.  \n  \n(k) \nAgain, if A. having pawned his. watch to Z, takes it of Z's possession without Z's \nconsent not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch \nis his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.  \n  \n(l) \nA takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the \nintention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration Here A \ntakes dishonestly: A has. therefore, committed theft.  \n  \n(m) \nA being on friendly terms with Z, goes to Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away \na book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it. and with the \nintention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's \nimplied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A .has not committed theft  \n  \n(n) \nA asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to \nbelong to her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised \nto give away alms. If this was A's impression. A has not committed theft.  \n  \n(o) \nA is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong \nto her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes \nthe property dishonestly, he commits theft.  \n  \n(p) \nA. in good faith believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that \nproperty out of S's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit \ntheft.",

B commits forgery.  \n  \n(e) \nA draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending \nto discount it as. a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. \nHere, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that \nhe had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.  \n  \n(f) \nZ's will contains these words: \"I direct that all my remaining property be equally \ndivided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may \nbe believed that the whole was left to himself and C, A has committed forgery.  \n  \n(g) \nA endorses a Government promissory-note and makes it payable to Z or his order by \nwriting on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the endorsement. B \ndishonestly erases the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and thereby converts the special \nendorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.  \n  \n(h) \nA sells and conveys an estate to Z, A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate' \nexecutes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of \nthe conveyance to Z, Intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before \nhe conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.  \n  \n(i) \nZ dictate his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee \nnamed by Z, and by representing to Z, that he has prepared th6 will according to his \ninstructions, Induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.  \n  \n(j) \nA writes a- fetter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is \na man of good character and distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, \nintending by means of such letter to obtain aims from Z and other persons.

A has committed forgery \ninasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to \nenter into an express or implied contract for service.  \n  \nExplanation 1: A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery.  \n  \nIllustrations  \n(a) \nA signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the \nbill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.  \n  \n(b) \nA writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and sings it with Z's name, in order \nthat 8 may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and \nnegotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing \nthe fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.  \n  \n© A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name \nA endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed \nby the person to whose order it was payable, here A has committed forgery.  \n  \n(d) \nA purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the  seizure \nof the estate, in collusion With Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and \nfor a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud \nA, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. S, though \nhe executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.  \n  \n(e) \nA, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with \nintent to defraud his creditors and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a \npromissory-note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates that \nnote, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of \ninsolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.  \n  \nExplanation 2: The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending \nit to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased \nperson, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, \nmay amount to forgery.  \n  \nIllustration  \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the \nname of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.
